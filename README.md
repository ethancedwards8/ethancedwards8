I'm currently studying for my CompTIA Linux+ and AZ-900 exams.

I've been using Linux full time since 7th grade and I've loved every second of it.

## Experience and Skills

I host websites for clients that vary from a simple wordpress site to a Nextcloud server.

This past summer I did an internship at a local business, working on CentOS 7+8 servers with Docker and NFS.

Some tools and skills I've picked up:

- Rust, Python, and Bash/Shell
- Anything Linux/UNIX, Git, Docker Swarm, PGP/GPG, Digital Ocean
- Emacs and Vim, Org mode, LaTeX, Markdown, and HTML/CSS
- [NixOS](https://nixos.org)/[nix-darwin](https://github.com/lnl7/nix-darwin) and `nix` package manager for fully reproducible deployment and builds down to the byte, plus [declarative system managerment](https://gitlab.com/ethancedwards/dotfiles/-/blob/master/)
